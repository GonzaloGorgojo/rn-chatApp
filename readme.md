# Chat App :iphone:

### What is this :grey_question:

This is a Mobile App where you can chat with random people, the last 25 messages will be shown in chat screen !

### :bulb: How can i try this app :grey_question:

- You need an android device or an android emulator (IOS wont let you use it because of permissions)
- You need to install Expo ([What is Expo?](https://expo.dev/))
- copy this link and paste in expo: exp://exp.host/@gongorgojo/ChatApp
- You dont have to sing up with your real email, you can use whatever you want. Firebase does not validate real emails here.
- Finally you can try it :smiley:

### :computer: Technologies used

- React-Native
- Expo
- Redux
- I18next

- Run `npm i`
- you will need to write your own firebase.js file with your firebase credentials
- Then you can check it out using `npm start`
- You can use an android emulator with expo to test it
